# Evaluating the Odd-Even Policy's Impact on Air Quality in Delhi: A Causal Study

## Abstract
This repository  delves into the impact of Delhi's odd-even traffic policy on air quality, focusing on particulate matter (PM2.5) levels. Employing a Difference-in-Differences methodology, it scrutinizes daily PM2.5 measurements from multiple monitoring stations in Delhi and surrounding areas. The study aims to provide empirical evidence on the policy's effectiveness in reducing air pollution and includes comprehensive statistical analyses and robustness checks like placebo tests.

## Objective:

- To assess the impact of the odd-even policy on PM2.5 levels in Delhi.
- To contribute to the discussion on urban traffic regulations and their role in environmental policy-making.

## Methodology:

- Analysis of daily PM2.5 data from Delhi's monitoring stations.
- Application of the Difference-in-Differences approach.
- Conducting robustness checks and placebo tests.

## Key Findings:

- Preliminary evidence suggesting a marginal reduction in PM2.5 levels during the policy period.
- Insights into the potential effectiveness of traffic regulation policies in urban pollution control.

## Implications:

- The paper discusses the broader implications for urban environmental policy, with a focus on developing cities.
- Provides a framework for future research in the field of urban air quality management.
